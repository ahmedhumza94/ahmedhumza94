### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### NOW

I'm an indepedent data scientist helping academic research teams with data strategy.

##### RECENTLY

I served as a Neuroimaging Analyst at the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center.

ðŸ”­ I contributed to investigating the vascular correlates of aging using various MRI techniques such as:

- Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)
- Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Imaging
- Phase Contrast Angiography (PCA)
- T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) Imaging

Programming languages I used for this work included: `.r`, `.python`, `.matlab`, `.bash`

##### BIO

I am a Biomedical Engineer who strongly believes that mathematical modeling of physiological systems can guide the development of personalized medicine. My expertise involves the acquisition and processing of time-series and spatial physiological signals. In addition, I have experience with common classification, clustering, and regression machine learning models. For over nine years I have used statistical and analytical models to tackle poorly understood medical issues.
