### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Biomedical Engineer who strongly believes that mathematical modeling of physiological systems can guide the development of personalized medicine. My expertise involves the acquisition and processing of time-series and spatial physiological signals. In addition, I have experience with common classification, clustering, and regression machine learning models. For over eight years I have used statistical and analytical models to tackle poorly understood medical issues.I have served in technical roles as part of a research team at organizations including:

    University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
    Boston University
    Baylor College of Medicine
    Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimerâ€™s Center
    Social Neuroscience of Pain Disparities Lab at Texas A&M University
    Michael E. Debakey Institute at Texas A&M University
