### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##### NOW

I'm a part of the Apple developer community. I am currently looking for full-time or freelance iOS developer roles as well as building my own projects. I have a passion for the Swift language, SwiftUI, and utilizing Swift for server-side projects.

##### BIO

I spent most of the last decade focused on using analytical models to tackle poorly understood medical issues. Over my career, I have built automated pipelines to process large medical imaging datasets. I am in the midst of a career transition and hope to give back to the developer community through blogging.

I have served in technical roles as part of a research team at organizations including:

    University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
    Boston University
    Baylor College of Medicine
    Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimerâ€™s Center
    Social Neuroscience of Pain Disparities Lab at Texas A&M University
    Michael E. Debakey Institute at Texas A&M University
